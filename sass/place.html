<h3><span class="menu"></span>Espresso</span></h3>
<li>Espresso is made by forcing nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans, which results in a concentrated, syrup-like coffee drink. This is the base for many Italian beverages in coffee shops. When compared to regular brewed coffee, espresso is much stronger than the other types of coffee drinks. Espressos are enjoyed in shots where a single shot is one ounce and a long (single and double) shot is two ounces in amount, respectively.</li>

   <div class="latte">

<h3><span class="menu>">Latte/Iced Latte</span></h3> 
<li>A latte is an espresso with steamed milk and a dollop of milk foam on top. This beverage is more prevalent in America than other coffee drinks like cappuccinos because it contains less foam, making it smoother and gentler for those with sensitive palettes. And if you want to spice up your latte, add some flavouring syrup. To make an iced version of this drink, simply pour espresso and steamed milk over ice cubes.</li>

<h3><span class="menu">Black Coffee</span></h3>

<h3><span class="menu">Americano</span></h3> 
<li>The Americano is another popular type of coffee drink, and it's very easy to make! It's just espresso with hot water dripping over it. The name came about during World War II when European baristas added water to their espresso drinks for the American soldiers stationed there. The resulting drink had a smoother, less concentrated flavour than espresso and thus the Americano was born.</li>

<li>The word "macchiato" means spotted, so a macchiato espresso is an espresso with a splash of milk.

<h3><span class="menu">Cold Brew</span></h3>
<li>Cold brew coffee is created by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cool or room temperature water for an extended period, often 12 hours or more.

Some baristas also choose to add flavouring syrups to cold brews for lighter drink options.</dli>

<!-- 14. Affogato -->
<!-- This dessert is less of a type of coffee drink and more of an ice cream sundae. Rather than having ice cream or gelato with hot espresso poured over it, the hot espresso slightly melts the ice cream and the corresponding ice cream cools down the beverage. They complement each other perfectly. -->
